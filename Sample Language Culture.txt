This culture thinks that the whole destiny (which is the same word for god) of the world is already written, every action of every person in the world is already made and every person thinks to have
free will but doesn't have it, they think, the world will keep working thanks to them because if every person in the world doesn't do anything, nothing will be made,
nothing will change and the "big void" will eat the whole world, destroying everything. And for this reason they keep inventing, creating and working because they fear the void
